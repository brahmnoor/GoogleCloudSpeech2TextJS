# Gogle Cloud API Text to Speech using pure client side Javascript
This project was built for Teli at The University of Hong Kong. This uses Google Cloud Speech APIs to convert text to speech, unlike other counterparts - this is done entierly on the client side.

## Production Tips
- This is not production ready because it might mean exposing your API keys, so handle that carefully before deployment.
- Another version of this using Express and Socket (for real time text to speech conversion) was made [here](https://github.com/brahmnoor/TextToSpeech "here").
